# Oso go library

This is the updated repository for the oso go library. It contains prebuilt oso-core
libraries so that you can reference this module directly in go code.

All development happens on https://github.com/osohq/oso.

`go get github.com/osohq/go-oso`

```
    import "github.com/osohq/go-oso"
    ...
```
